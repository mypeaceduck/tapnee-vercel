Tapnee is a platform that empowers you to create your very own tap-to-earn game with ease. By simply creating a JSON file and minting an NFT Tapnee, your game will be added to the Tapnee game store. This single JSON file will contain all the necessary graphics and settings for your game, making the development process straightforward and efficient.

### How It Works

1. **Create Your JSON File**: The JSON file is the heart of your game. It includes all the details and configurations needed to bring your game to life. Here’s what you can include:

   - **Basic Information**: Set the game’s name, description, and theme colors to make your game stand out.
   - **Graphics**: Use SVG images to define the visual elements of your game. You can make each element tappable to enhance the interactive experience.
   - **Game Economy**: Introduce your personal token, which players can use to make in-game purchases and upgrades. This adds an economic layer to your game, encouraging more engagement.
   - **Rewards System**: Set up a secret combination that players can discover to unlock special airdrop rewards. This adds an element of mystery and excitement to your game.
   - **Tap Limitations**: Define the maximum number of taps allowed within a certain time frame (e.g., X taps per Y minutes). This helps in controlling the game flow and increasing its challenge.

2. **Mint Your NFT Tapnee**: Once your JSON file is ready, mint an NFT Tapnee. This NFT represents your game on the blockchain, ensuring its uniqueness and ownership.

3. **Launch on Tapnee Game Store**: After minting, your game will be added to the Tapnee game store, where players from around the world can discover and play it.
